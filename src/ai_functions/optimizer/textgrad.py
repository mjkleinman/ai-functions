"""TextGrad-style optimizer over a reconstructed computation graph.

Walks a ``ThreadNode`` graph in reverse topological order. At each node an
internal AI function distributes the node's accumulated feedback across its
routable targets: its grad-enabled ``ParameterNode`` inputs *and* its child
``ThreadNode`` s that lead to a grad-enabled parameter. Feedback routed to a
parameter accumulates for consolidation; feedback routed to a child thread is
*refined* feedback appended to that child, which re-distributes it to its own
targets when it is visited later in the walk. Parameter gradients are finally
consolidated directly into the memory backends referenced by each
``ParameterNode``.
