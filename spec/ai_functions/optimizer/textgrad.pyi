"""TextGrad-style optimizer over a reconstructed computation graph.

Walks a :class:`ThreadNode` graph in reverse topological order, using an
internal AI function to distribute natural-language feedback from each node to
its grad-enabled parameter inputs, then consolidates that feedback directly
into the memory backends referenced by each :class:`ParameterNode`.

``backward`` / ``consolidate`` are pure consumers of an already-built graph:
they never read the event log or touch a running thread. ``step`` is the
one-call form over a traced :class:`Result`: it builds the graph (spawned
children from events, sibling edges from ``Result.inputs``), backpropagates,
and consolidates — on the same graph object, built exactly once. The autograd
analogy is exact — ``backward`` is ``loss.backward()`` (textual gradients
instead of numeric), ``consolidate`` is ``optimizer.step()`` (writes
improvements back into memory).

        node's accumulated gradients into per-parameter feedback (matched by
        ``node_id``). The node's gradients are then forwarded to its child
        threads, which re-refine them against their own parameters when visited

              text; a score-learning host (the economics beliefs adapter) uses
              the score.
